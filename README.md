  ## Installation

  To install the application on your local machine, start by cloning the repository to a local file. Once the application has been cloned and you have navigated into the source folder via your terminal, run the command 'npm i' to install all of the needed dependencies. Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run the command 'npm start' to run the server on your local machine.

  ## Usage

  Once the application has been installed to your local machine, you can navigate to the source folder each time you wish to launch the server. One in the source folder, run the command 'npm start' to start the server locally. You can now use a third party application to test the api calls in for each model.
